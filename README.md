# dep_injection_example

Tiny quickly coded example using dependency injection in python.

Also an example for metaclasses added. Seems they are really powerful and allow you to modify how a class behaves.
This however has the danger of making your code less readable and a lot of times introduces a performance hit you most likely
don't want or expect.

Added some async wrapping and examples to run as default event thread pool, a custom thread pool or process pool.
